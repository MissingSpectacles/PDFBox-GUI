# PDFBox GUI

## Background

I made this because every PDF tool requires purchasing before I can edit them.  
I only need to merge PDFs and extract images from PDF.  
The only open source PDF tool is [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/), but the easy way to use it is via the [Command Line Tools](https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/commandline.html).  
Hence, I made a GUI out of it with JavaFX.  
Any correction is appreciated.  

## Specification

### Build Tool
